She officially assumed the throne on July 10, 1553. However, the country had different plans. They rallied around Mary, the daughter of Catherine of Aragon and a devout member of the Roman Catholic Church. After a brief nine day rule, even Jane's father withdrew his support for her reign, and she was deposed. She was executed alongside her husband in 1554.</p>

                    <p class="right-column">Mary I was the first English queen to reign not through marriage to a king, but by her own right. She was said to be incredibly brave, but also incredibly stubborn. Parliament declared her illegitimate in 1533 which removed her from the line of succession, but she regained her right to the throne in 1544. Her brother, Edward, however, removed her from succession once again, due to her faithfulness to the Catholic Church and rejection of the English Protestant Church. Mary, however, brought the Catholic Church back to England, and, in three years' time, burnt about 300 accused heretics at the stake. This brought wild unpopularity upon Mary, especially among the gentry and the aristocracy, and even earned her the nickname "Bloody Mary." She married Philip, the future King of Spain, in 1554, but never gave birth to a child. She passed away in 1558, probably due to cancer, without a Catholic heir to succeed her.</p>

                    <p class="right-column">Elizabeth I was the last Tudor monarch, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth became queen when her half-sister, Queen Mary I, passed away in 1558. She was said to be very intelligent and determined. During her 45 year reign, she established a stable Church of England, and the arts in the country flourished. Elizabeth even had the honor of attending the opening night performance of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream." In 1568, Mary, Queen of Scots, fled to England after her second husband was murdered. Elizabeth imprisoned Mary for 19 years because along with Mary came plots of rebellion and even assassinations. Elizabeth eventually executed Mary in 1587. At the end of her reign, Elizabeth had amassed a massive national debt due to her many wars with various countries, including Spain and France. She died somewhat of a legend to her people on March 24,1603, with no children.</p>

Together they accepted a Declaration from Parliament that, along with listing guarantees for freedom of speech and fair elections, limited the power of the monarchy and reaffirmed Parliament's powers over taxation and legislation. It also required the English sovereign(s) to swear and oath of loyalty to the Anglican Church at their coronation. Under her reign, Mary saw a rapid split in Parliament into two parties: the Tories and the Whigs. She died of smallpox in 1694, having born no children.</p>

                    <p class="right-column">Most of Anne's reign was overshadowed by the War of the Spanish Succession. She also saw the strengthening of party politics, as the Tories and Whigs continued to compete for power in Parliament. Her reign was also plagued with disputes between Scotland and England, as the English Parliament declared her successor to be the Protestant Sophia of Hanover, which disgruntled the Catholic Scots. Eventually, the two entities settled on a common flag and currency, but allowed Scotland to retain its Catholicism. Anne died in August 1714, and, as Sophia of Hanover had already passed away by her death, she was succeeded by Sophia's son George.</p>
